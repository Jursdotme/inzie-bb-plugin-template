# Inzite Beaver Builder Plugin Tailwind Template

[Beaver Builder Custom module docs](https://docs.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-builder/developer/custom-modules/)

A simple starter project for playing around with Tailwind in a proper PostCSS environment.

## Building for production

Even though this isn't necessarily a starter kit for a proper project, we've included an example of setting up both [Purgecss](https://www.purgecss.com/) and [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) to optimize your CSS for production.

To build an optimized version of your CSS, simply run:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run production
```
